Introduction to Python
======================

Slides are created as an IPython Notebook (IPython 1.0) and exported to
reveal.js.


Installation in a virtual environment
-------------------------------------

Required IPython version is 1.0 and you can install it from source in a
virtual environment like this (on Debian Wheezy):

    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages programming-course

We need IPython 1.0 which is not yet released, so we get it from GitHub:

    pip install -e git+https://github.com/ipython/ipython#egg=ipython

If IPython 1.0 is released, you can just do this:

    pip install ipython

Some additional packages:

    pip install pyzmq tornado jinja2 pygments sphinx markdown
    pip install numpy

For matplotlib, we need some development and system packages:

    sudo aptitude install libfreetype6-dev libpng12-dev python-cairo \
      python-gtk2 python-gtk2-dev
    mkdir -p $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    ln -s /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/{glib,gobject,gtk-2.0*,pygtk.pth} \
      $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
    ln -s /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/cairo \
      $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

    pip install matplotlib
    echo "backend : GTKCairo" >> ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc

If you want the IPython qtconsole to work, I found the following snippet to
take PyQT from system packages:

We might want to use the same approach for the PyGTK/PyCAIRO stuff above.


Editing the slides
------------------

    ipython notebook --pylab inline

Some aditional information on editing slides in the Notebook can be found
here:

Exporting the slides
--------------------

This will create a set of slides to be viewed in a browser:

    ipython nbconvert reveal python-intro.ipynb

If you're not connected to the internet, make sure you have the reveal.js
submodule repository initialized, otherwise you won't have any styling and
navigation in your slides:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

As a reference for students, you could also create a full HTML dump:

    ipython nbconvert full_html python-intro.ipynb
