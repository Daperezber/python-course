Programming course
==================

The course is targeted at PhD students, Postdocs, or anyone willing to learn
how to program in Python. Students are assumed to have some experience with
programming, but not necessarily in Python. In addition, they should bring
their own laptops for the practical sessions.

## Prerequisites

Affinity with the UNIX shell and git is required. For this reason it is
mandatory to follow our
[Practical Linux](https://git.lumc.nl/courses/practical-linux-course)
and [Code and data management with git](https://git.lumc.nl/courses/gitcourse)
courses before.
